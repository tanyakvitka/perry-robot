# Perry Robot
## Tennis Ball Color Recognition and Robot Control

This Python project contains scripts for color recognition calibration with OpenCV of a tennis ball, as well as a script for control via the serial Bluetooth port of the robot, depending on the location of the ball on the video stream relative to the buffer zone.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- PySerial
- PyGame
- Numpy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip: pip install opencv-python pyserial pygame numpy

## Usage

### Color Recognition Calibration

1. Connect your camera to your computer.
2. Open ColorCalibration.py in your preferred Python editor.
3. Run the script.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to calibrate the color recognition for your tennis ball.

### Robot Control

1. Connect your robot to your computer via Bluetooth.
2. Open MainWorkScript.py in your preferred Python editor.
3. Run the script.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to control the robot based on the location of the tennis ball in the video stream.
